## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a vulnerability is reported, we will start fixing it within 48 hours after responding.

It will also be reported at the beginning and end of the fix.

If the vulnerability cannot be fixed after 48 hours, the system of the vulnerable part will be deleted and the project will not be published until the fix is completed.
